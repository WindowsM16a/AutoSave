## AutoSave üñ•Ô∏èüíæ

AutoSave is a lightweight utility designed to alleviate the anxiety of losing work due to unexpected software crashes, tailored with a touch of sophistication and reliability.

### Introduction

AutoSave gracefully automates the mundane yet crucial task of saving your documents at regular intervals, sparing you the anguish of potential data loss. Developed primarily with Adobe software users in mind, its versatility extends to any application where document preservation is paramount.

### Features

- **Effortless Operation**: With a simple activation, AutoSave diligently ensures your documents are safeguarded without disrupting your workflow.
- **Customizable Intervals**: Tailor the save frequency to suit your needs, with adjustable intervals as brief as 10 seconds or as expansive as your creative process demands.
- **Adaptability**: Designed to accommodate various software environments, AutoSave can be effortlessly configured to match alternate key combinations for saving documents.

### Usage

1. **Installation**: Simply clone the AutoSave repository to your local machine and install whatever you may need to.

2. **Configuration**: Modify the source code to adjust the interval between saves or customize the key combination for saving documents if needed.
